**PART 2: Calculate your Big Five scores**

Follow these steps exactly:

**STEP A: Reverse-score these items**
For items 6, 8, 9, 18, 21, 23, 24, 27, 31, 34, 35, 37, 41, 43:
Convert your rating using: New score = 6 - Original score
(Example: if you rated item 6 as "4", the reversed score is 6-4 = 2)

**STEP B: Calculate trait averages**

Use your ratings (with reversed items from Step A):

- **Extraversion** = Average of items: 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36
- **Agreeableness** = Average of items: 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42
- **Conscientiousness** = Average of items: 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43
- **Neuroticism** = Average of items: 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 39
- **Openness** = Average of items: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 41, 44

**STEP C: Interpret each score**
- Score < 2.5 = Low
- Score 2.5-3.5 = Moderate
- Score > 3.5 = High

**STEP D: Display your results**

Format your output like this:

```
